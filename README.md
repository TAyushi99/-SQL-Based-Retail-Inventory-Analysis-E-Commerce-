# 🛒 Retail SQL Inventory Analysis (E-Commerce)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how SQL is used in real-world **retail and e-commerce inventory analysis**. The focus is on working with a **messy, production-like dataset**, performing data exploration and cleaning, and answering business-driven questions related to pricing, inventory, stock availability, and revenue insights.

The project simulates the type of backend analysis performed by data analysts in e-commerce companies to support pricing, merchandising, and inventory decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Work with raw, unstructured retail inventory data  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL  
- Clean and standardize pricing and inventory fields  
- Analyze product pricing, discounts, stock availability, and category performance  
- Derive actionable business insights using SQL queries

## 📁 Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project was sourced from **Kaggle** and represents an e-commerce inventory system similar to quick-commerce platforms.

- The data was originally scraped from real product listings  
- Each row represents a unique **SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)**  
- Duplicate product names exist due to variations in:
  - Package size  
  - Weight  
  - Discount percentage  
  - Category placement  

This closely reflects how real-world retail catalog data is structured.

## 🧾 Dataset Schema
Key columns included in the dataset:

- `sku_id` – Unique identifier for each SKU  
- `name` – Product name  
- `category` – Product category (Fruits, Snacks, Beverages, etc.)  
- `mrp` – Maximum Retail Price (converted from paise to ₹)  
- `discount_percent` – Discount applied on MRP  
- `discounted_price` – Final selling price  
- `available_quantity` – Units available in inventory  
- `weight_in_gms` – Product weight  
- `out_of_stock` – Stock availability indicator  
- `quantity` – Units per package  

---

## 🗄️ Database Setup
A structured table was created in PostgreSQL to store and analyze the data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE zepto (
  sku_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  category VARCHAR(120),
  name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
  mrp NUMERIC(8,2),
  discount_percent NUMERIC(5,2),
  available_quantity INTEGER,
  discounted_price NUMERIC(8,2),
  weight_in_gms INTEGER,
  out_of_stock BOOLEAN,

📥 Data Loading

Imported the dataset into PostgreSQL using pgAdmin

Resolved encoding issues by converting the CSV file to UTF-8 format

Validated data ingestion using record counts and sample queries

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

SQL queries were used to:

Count total SKUs and product categories

Identify missing and inconsistent values

Compare in-stock vs out-of-stock products

Detect duplicate product names representing multiple SKUs

Explore pricing and discount distributions

🧹 Data Cleaning & Standardization

Data cleaning steps included:

Removing rows with invalid pricing values (zero or null MRP / selling price)

Converting pricing fields from paise to rupees for consistency

Validating discount calculations and stock indicators

  quantity INTEGER
);
